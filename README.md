# Credits
The inspiration for this came grom the Hand-Drawn Button snippets here: https://codemyui.com/hand-drawn-border-buttons-css/

This repo those ideas to cover not just buttons but every conceivable element. Note that I didn't actually test this past the elements defined in the example so there's probably something that's a bit off.
